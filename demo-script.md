*"Imagine a world where DeFi protocols can automatically capitalize on market opportunities 24/7, generating yield without human intervention. That's exactly what we've built with Ammunition Vault."*

**[Visual: Dramatic slow-motion clips of financial markets, blockchain networks, and automated trading systems]**

## üîç **Problem Statement (0:30 - 1:15)**
*"In traditional DeFi, liquidity providers earn passive income but miss out on active trading opportunities. Flash loan arbitrage exists but requires:
- ‚ö° Lightning-fast execution
- üîç Real-time market analysis
- üí∞ Significant capital requirements
- üß† Complex strategy optimization

Most protocols leave millions in potential profit on the table every day."*
